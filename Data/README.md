### EvolveSim, EvolveSim2
See Src/python/evolve_sim.py for naming conventions

### GMeCh
Input files and results for the G-MeCh model presented in the paper.
"energy.npy" and "free_energy.npy"  were generated using "Src/python/post-processing.py"

"df2" in "main_figs.py" can be obtained by running "post-processing.process_test_01"

### NoSeq
Contains results for the MeCh model, across the full range of K, with epsilon = 8


### AllE
Contains a Template folder, and setup / submission scripts to generate data.
Full data is about 6GB, but does not take long to run.
